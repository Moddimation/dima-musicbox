Compiled with VS22  
A little Project of mine, playing a set amount of undertale music tracks  
To Start run "Engine.exe" inside the x64/Release, or x64/Devel for testing purposes  
I use Debug in realy rare cases, devel all the time and Release for a new stable version  
The exe cant work on its own without the files sorrounding it(dll, char and music)  
The Release in releases isnt updated often, please use the one in /x64/Release/  

It hangs a few seconds on boot, thats normal


Controls:  
Up | Down    =  Change current track  
Left | Right =  Change Looping amount(COMING SOON)  
Enter        =  Play selected song  
ESC          =  Stop current song
