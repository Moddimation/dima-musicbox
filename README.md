Compiled with VS22

A little Project of mine, currently playing 9 preset songs.
To Start run "Engine.exe" inside the x64/Release, or x64/Devel for testing purposes (but i usually compile latest code with Release, runs smoother)
It hangs a few seconds on boot, thats normal

Controls:

Up | Down  =  Change current track

Enter      =  Play

ESC        =  Stop current song
